# Sujita Portfolio

# Project 1 : Walmart Sales Forecasting
* Optimized and deployed a machine learning model to predict the sales of the Walmart for the next 12 weeks.
* Models Used: Facebook Prophet, ARIMA.
* Operations Perfomed:EDA, visualizations: matplotlib & seaborn.

# Project 2: Analyzing the trends of Covid-19
* Given data about COVID 19 patients, writing code to visualize the impact and analyze the trend of rate of infection and recovery as well as make predictions about the number of cases expected a week in future based on the current trends.
* Use plotly (visualization library) to create interactive visualizations.
* Use Facebook prophet library to make time series models.
* Visualize the prediction by combining these technologies.

# Project 3 : Binary Class Classification using Neural Networks
* Solving a binary class classification problem using Keras module on the Titanic dataset.
* Model Used: Artificial Neural Network Architecture using Keras.
* Operations: Data Preprocessing, One Hot Encoding, Scaling, Using Activation function.

# Project 4 : Implemented VGG16 ON CIPHAR 10 DATASET IN CNN (Multiclass Classification Problem)
* To use a pre trained model VGG16 on top of the model instead of building it from the scratch using Keras.
* Model Used: Convolutional Neural Network using Keras.
* Operations: Data Preprocessing, To the VGG layers adding the fully connected layers and the output layer, One Hot Encoding, Scaling, Using Activation function.
* Acuuracy of the model increased tremendously after using the pre-trained model on the CIPHAR10 dataset.
